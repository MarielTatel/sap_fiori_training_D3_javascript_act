## DAY 3 - JavaScript Activity

Compilation of JavaScript activity for SAP Fiori SAPUI5 Basic Training

1. Given a number ‘number’, assuming it’s ranging from 1 – 999, convert it into words using If… else condition or simply if conditions or switch statement.
    
    > Sample input:
    ``` 789 ```

    > Sample output: 
    ```Seven Hundred Eighty Nine ```

<br>

2. Using While Loop, print the pattern given. Given ‘height’ as height of the triangle and assuming it is not a negative number.

    > Sample input:
        ``` height = 5 ```

    > Sample output:
    > ```
    > * * * * * 
    >   * * * * 
    >     * * * 
    >       * * 
    >         * 
    > ```

<br>

3.	Using For Loop, print the pattern given. Given ‘height’ as height of the ‘X’ sign and assuming it is not a negative number and ‘height’ is an odd number.

    > Sample input:
        ``` height = 5 ```

    > Sample output:
    > ```
    > *       * 
    >   *   *   
    >     *     
    >   *   *   
    > *       * 
    > ```

<br>

4.	Create a function that calculates the perimeter of a triangle. Function should return the value of perimeter.

    > Input:
    > ```
    > sideA = 3;
    > sideB = 3;
    > sideC = 2;
    > ```

    > Output:
    > ```
    > Perimeter of triangle with sides (3, 3, 2) = 8
    > ```

<br>

5.	Given an array of colors, write a JavaScript program to display the colors in a given way with their ordinal suffix (must display until the last color in the array accordingly).

    > Input:
    > ```
    > color = ["Blue", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow"]; 
    > ```

    > Output:
    > ```
    > 1st choiice is Blue.
    > 2nd choice is Green.
    > 3rd choice is Red.
    > 4th choice is Orange.
    > 5th choice is Violet.
    > 6th choice is Indigo.
    > 7th choice is Yellow.
    > ```

<br>

6.	Given the data, output the data (Name and Age) of the person with the highest number of skillsets. A dynamic code should be created.

    > Input:
    > ```
    > record = [{
    >    "Name": "Gibo",
    >    "Age": 16,
    >    "SkillSet": [{
    >        "Skill": "SAP UI5"
    >    }, {
    >        "Skill": "SAP HANA"
    >    }]
    > }, {
    >    "Name": "Patrick",
    >    "Age": 22,
    >    "SkillSet": [{
    >        "Skill": "SAP UI5"
    >    }, {
    >        "Skill": "SAP HANA"
    >    }, {
    >        "Skill": "SAP ABAP"
    >    }]
    > }, {
    >    "Name": "MJ",
    >    "Age": 24,
    >    "SkillSet": [{
    >        "Skill": "SAP HANA"
    >    }]
    > }];
    > ```

    > Output:
    > ```
    > Person with the highest number of skillset:
    > 	Patrick, 22
    > ```
